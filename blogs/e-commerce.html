                    <h1 class="sub-title">Why did I use those technologies?</h1>
                    <p>These Technologies were used because they were the most effecient in producing the desired
                    end product for the website. With the use of React, my website is able to quickly give feedback
                    from the users requests without any time wastage. React also allows me to easily implement things 
                    that would take longer if I had simply used JAVASCRIPT, CSS and HTML.

                    <p>Most of the difficulties that were faced involved looking for syntax errors, and also searching
                    how to implement certain functions into the program.
